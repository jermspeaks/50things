title: About This Template
---

The inspiration behind this website is a talk from blinry that went over his blog
post, [Fifty Things you can do with a Software Defined Radio ðŸ“»](https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/).
He was inspired by [Vi Hart's Fifty Fizzbuzzes](https://github.com/vihart/fiftyfizzbuzzes/blob/master/Fifty%20Fizzbuzzes.ipynb).

Simon Willison wrote a blog post earlier this year that helps frame this website.
[Give people something to link to so they can talk about your features and ideas](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/13/give-people-something-to-link-to/). I couldn't agree more.
